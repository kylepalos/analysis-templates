# Research analyses

This repository is meant to host analysis templates for the various research projects that I have worked on.

I will try to provide the necessary input data where I can, but some projects may be too sensitive/far from publishing that I cannot make the data freely available.

Additionally, as projects become published, I will post all the necessary analyses here.
